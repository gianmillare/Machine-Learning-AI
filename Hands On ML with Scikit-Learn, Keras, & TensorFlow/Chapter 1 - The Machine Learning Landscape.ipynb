    "<u>Definition</u>: The training set (data) you feed into the algorithm includes the desired solution (often called 'labels').\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Classification is a typical supervised learning task. Spam filters is an example of Supervised Learning, where users tell the filter what is Spam / Ham and the machine learns to classify future emails as Spam as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Predictions is another use case for supervised learning. We can predict numerical values (i.e. prices) given a set of features (brands, mileage, etc.) called predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a <strong>Regression</strong> based approach to Supervised Learning. To train the model, you would need to give the computer examples. For example: Honda average car is 30,000 and Mercedes average car is 70,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Logistic Regression</strong> is another type of regression that is often used in classifications. Logistic regression can be used to find the probability rhat something belongs to a specific class (i.e. this email has a 20% chance of being spam)\n",

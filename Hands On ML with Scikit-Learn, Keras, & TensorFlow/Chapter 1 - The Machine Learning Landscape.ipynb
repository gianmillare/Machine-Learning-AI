    "#### <strong>Supervised  Learning<strone>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Definition</u>: The training set (data) you feed into the algorithm includes the desired solution (often called 'labels').\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Classification is a typical supervised learning task. Spam filters is an example of Supervised Learning, where users tell the filter what is Spam / Ham and the machine learns to classify future emails as Spam as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Predictions is another use case for supervised learning. We can predict numerical values (i.e. prices) given a set of features (brands, mileage, etc.) called predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a <strong>Regression</strong> based approach to Supervised Learning. To train the model, you would need to give the computer examples. For example: Honda average car is 30,000 and Mercedes average car is 70,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Logistic Regression</strong> is another type of regression that is often used in classifications. Logistic regression can be used to find the probability rhat something belongs to a specific class (i.e. this email has a 20% chance of being spam)\n",

    "#### <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>\n",
    "<u>Definition</u>: When feeding data into the system, the training data is unlabeled. In other words, the system tries to learn without a teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Examples of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms</u>  \n",
    "Clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)  \n",
    "Anomaly Detection and Novelty Detection: One-class SVM, Isolation Forest  \n",
    "Visualization and Dimensionality Reduction: Kernel PCA, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)  \n",
    "Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Examples</u>  \n",
    "You own a website/blog and want to know if your visitors have any similarities. In this case, you do not tell the system what the categories/classifications are. Instead the system does it for you. For example, if most of your viewers are Males and visit in the evening, the system may classify them as \"Male, evenings only\". Pro tip: with this kind of analysis, you may run a hierarchical cluster analysis to divide the classifications into subgroups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Dimensionality Reduction</u>  \n",
    "Lets say we find a strong correlation between age of a car and mileage. We can then group them into a specific class titled \"wear and tear\". This is called <u>feature extraction</u>  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Anomaly Detection</u>  \n",
    "For example, Credit card fraud. Anomaly Detection will sense for any unusual activity on the card. This method can sometimes be used to remove outliers before feeding more data to another algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Association Rule Learning</u>\n",
    "If you own a supermarket, and this algorithms notices that people that bought charcoal and lighter fluid also tend to buy steaks and ground beef, the system will associate the two. You may then conclude to place the items near each other. "

    "#### <strong>Semisupervised Learning</strong>  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Use Case:</u> Labelling data can be time consuming and costly, and scientists may have several unlabelled instances. Semisupervised Learning can assist in labelling these unknowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Example:</u> Google Photos - when someone uploads 10 photos, it may recognize that personA is in photos 1, 7, 10 while personB is in photos 1, 4, 8 (this is an example of <strong>Clustering, Unsupervised Learning</strong>). All one would need to do is label personA on photo 1, and Google Photos will enable <strong>Semisupervised Learning</strong> to label personA in the other photos (photo 7 and 10)."

    "#### Reinforcement Training\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Definition:</u> in this algorithm, there is a 'learning system', called an <strong>agent</strong>, that can observe the environment, and select and perform actions. Depending on the output, the system will return rewards or penalties. Once the agent is rewarded (positively or negatively), it decides on the best strategy to choose an action given a certain situation, called a <strong>policy</strong>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Example:</u> DeepMind's AlphaGo program was able to beat the world champion at Go in May 2017. This machine learning algorithm used millions of winning strategies, played itself over and over, until it finally had a win percentage over a certain point."

    "#### Batch Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Definition:</u> in this learning, the system is fed all the data at one time. It is usually under <strong>offline training</strong> due to the amount of time it takes to 'ingest' and learn the data. However, because of this, the system is launched after offline training and is no longer trained afterward. What it learns from the data is what it outputs until the next batched training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Batch learning <strong>does not</strong> learn incrementally, everytime the system needs to learn a new feature (i.e. a new type of spam email), the system will need to go offline, the training data must be extracted, then the data of the new feature (i.e. new spam traits) must be added to the old data. Kind of like a cut and paste method with the old data and adding in the new data. The system will need to \"forget\" its past training, and be re-trained on the newly-completed dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Precautions:</u> Although the data is easier to manage this way, it is not the most ideal. Batch Learning requires alot of time, inconsistency, and resources (i.e. memory/RAM, CPU, disk space, etc.). It is preferred to use a ML algorithm that uses incremental learning."
